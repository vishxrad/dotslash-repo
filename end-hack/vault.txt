#### SECTION 3: PATIENT’S MEDICAL INFORMATION  

**Patient’s clinical history**:  
Mr. Tan Ah Kow was accompanied by his son, Mr. Tan Ah Beng, for the examination. Mr. Tan is a 55-year-old divorced, unemployed man currently living with his son in Ah Beng’s flat.  

Mr. Tan has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia since 1990 and suffered several strokes in 2005. He later developed heart problems (cardiomyopathy), cardiac failure, and chronic renal disease, for which he was treated at ABC Hospital.  

He was admitted to ABC Hospital from 1 April 2010 to 15 April 2010, during which he suffered a stroke confirmed by CT and MRI scans. Following this, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for stroke rehabilitation and later referred to Blackacre Hospital in November 2010. He has been manifesting behavioral and psychological symptoms secondary to dementia.  

Mr. Tan is currently incontinent and unable to bathe or use the toilet independently, though he can feed himself. Over the years, I have observed a gradual deterioration in his cognitive and physical condition.

#### SECTION 4: OPINION ON PATIENT’S MENTAL CAPACITY  

**Mental capacity for personal welfare**:  
- **Understand relevant information**: No  
- **Retain information**: No  
- **Weigh information**: No  
- **Communicate decisions**: Yes  

**Does the patient have mental capacity for personal welfare?**: No

- **Retain information**: No  
- **Weigh information**: No  
- **Communicate decisions**: Yes  

**Does the patient have mental capacity for property and affairs?**: No  

**Basis for opinion**:  
Mr. Tan’s dementia and stroke have impaired his cognitive and memory functions. His inability to retain or process simple information, recognize basic arithmetic, or remember essential facts about his property and medical conditions demonstrates his lack of capacity to make personal and financial decisions. His condition is unlikely to improve due to the irreversible nature of his dementia.
