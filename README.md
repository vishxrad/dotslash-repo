### Instructions:

## Requirements

1. **Pitch Deck**  
   - All submissions must include a **pitch deck** explaining your idea and its implementation.  
   
2. **Well-Commented Code**  
   - Ensure that all code is well-documented with comments and follows standard coding practices.  
   
3. **Mid-Hack Folder**  
   - Create a folder named `mid-hack` in your fork. This folder should contain all materials required for the **mid-hack submission**, including progress updates, initial implementation, and any supporting files.  

4. **Citation File**  
   - Include a `citations.md` file in your repository. All external resources (e.g., articles, tutorials, code snippets) must be properly cited here. Failure to do so may result in your project being flagged for plagiarism.

5. **End-Hack Folder**  
   - Create a folder named `end-hack` in your fork. This folder should contain all materials for the **final submission**, including the completed project, pitch deck, and any supplementary resources.

## Suggestions for Participants

1. **Maintain Clean and Consistent Code**  
   - Use comments and docstrings to document your code.  
   - Follow a consistent naming convention for files, functions, and variables to improve readability.

2. **Commit Regularly**  
   - Push commits frequently rather than submitting a single large commit at the end.  
   - This practice not only showcases your progress but also helps in avoiding plagiarism issues.

3. **Version Control Best Practices**  
   - Use branches for major features or experimental changes and merge them into the main branch after testing.  
   - Write clear, concise commit messages for better traceability.

4. **Utilize GitHub Issues and Pull Requests**  
   - Track tasks and discussions using GitHub Issues.  
   - Use Pull Requests (PRs) to review and merge changes within your team. This will help in maintaining a collaborative workflow.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Mid-Hack Checkpoint**  
  Submit the contents of your `mid-hack` folder by the designated checkpoint time. This will include progress updates and preliminary work.

- **Final Submission**  
  Ensure that all files for your final project are stored in the `end-hack` folder. Your pitch deck and `citations.md` file must also be updated and included here.
