May also include additional context or metadata depending on the dataset format.
Format: Compatible with Hugging Face's datasets library, making it easy to load, preprocess, and use in NLP pipelines.

Usage in Python
Hereâ€™s how to load and use the dataset with the Hugging Face datasets library:

python
Copy code
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("visharxd/medical-qna")

# Check the structure of the dataset
print(dataset)

# Access the train split
train_data = dataset["train"]

# Example: Print the first data entry
print(train_data[0])
Applications
Fine-Tuning LLMs: Use this dataset with pre-trained language models (like GPT, Llama, or BERT) to train medical-specific Q&A systems.
Zero-Shot or Few-Shot Learning: Prompt pre-trained LLMs with examples from the dataset for Q&A tasks without full fine-tuning.
Medical Assistant Development: Build AI tools for assisting healthcare professionals or patients with accurate medical responses.
