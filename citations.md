## **How We Used the Dataset**  

### **Step 1: Preparing the Dataset**  
We downloaded a medical Q&A dataset from Kaggle, reformatted it using a custom **JavaScript script**, and uploaded it to **Hugging Face** for compatibility with state-of-the-art NLP tools and frameworks.

### **Step 2: Loading the Dataset**  
The dataset is structured into pairs of questions (inputs) and answers (outputs).  
Hereâ€™s how to load it using the Hugging Face `datasets` library:  
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("visharxd/medical-qna")

# Access the training split
train_data = dataset["train"]

# View the first example
print(train_data[0])

```

## **Step 3: Loading the Model**
Use the Unsloth library to load the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B model:
```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# Load the model with 4-bit quantization
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name="unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B",
    load_in_4bit=True
)
```
Enable 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage and make training efficient.


## **Step 4: Applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
Fine-tune specific layers of the model using LoRA to reduce computational overhead:
```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r=16,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj"],
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0
)
```
LoRA focuses on specific layers like q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, etc., to improve efficiency.

## **Step 5: Formatting the Dataset**
Format the dataset into Alpaca-style prompts for instruction-based fine-tuning.
Prompt Template:
```python
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
<instruction>

### Input:
<input>

### Response:
<response>
```
Use a custom function to map each dataset example to this format:
```python

alpaca_prompt = """
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{}

### Input:
{}

### Response:
{}
"""

def formatting_prompts_func(examples):
    instructions = examples["context"]
    inputs = examples["question"]
    outputs = examples["answer"]
    texts = []
    for instruction, input, output in zip(instructions, inputs, outputs):
        text = alpaca_prompt.format(instruction, input, output)
        texts.append(text)
    return {"text": texts}
```
## **Step 6: Fine-Tuning the Model**
Use Hugging Face's SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer) to fine-tune the model:
```python
from trl import SFTTrainer
from transformers import TrainingArguments

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    args=TrainingArguments(
        per_device_train_batch_size=2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
        max_steps=1000,
        learning_rate=2e-4,
        fp16=True,
        logging_steps=1,
        optim="adamw_8bit",
        output_dir="outputs",
    ),
)
```
Configure training parameters:
Batch Size: 2 per device, gradient accumulation for 4 steps (effective batch size = 8).
Learning Rate: 2e-4.

## **Steps: Train for 1000 optimization steps.**

Optimizer: adamw_8bit for memory efficiency.
## **Step 7: Training and Saving the Model**
Train the model:
```python
trainer_stats = trainer.train()
```
Save the fine-tuned model to the outputs directory for future use.
Purpose and Benefits
The fine-tuned model is capable of:

Excelling in Instruction-Based Q&A Tasks:
Generates accurate and contextual responses for medical queries.
Enhancing Healthcare AI Tools:
Suitable for chatbots, education platforms, and automated assistants.
Optimizing Training Efficiency:
Utilizes LoRA and 4-bit quantization to save memory and reduce costs.
